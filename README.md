SUMMARY: An unknown DNA sequence was characterized using NCBI BLASTn and ORF Finder, identifying a high-confidence coding region and translating it into its corresponding protein sequence. Structural Insights: RNA analysis via RNAfold determined the mRNA's secondary structure stability, while InterPro and Pfam identified conserved functional domains and motifs within the protein. Physicochemical & Localization Profile: The protein's properties (MW, pI, and stability) were calculated using ProtParam, and its cellular destination was predicted through integrated TargetP and DeepLoc analysis. Evolutionary Context: A phylogenetic tree constructed from Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of homologous sequences revealed the protein's evolutionary relationships across diverse species STRING database analysis mapped a protein-protein interaction network, providing a systems-level view of the protein’s biological pathways and potential cellular roles.
